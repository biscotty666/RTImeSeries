# Box-Cox Transform

$$w_t = \begin{gather}\begin{cases}log(y_t) & \text{if  }\lambda = 0;\\ (y_t^\lambda-1)/\lambda & \text{otherwise;}\end{cases}\end{gather}$$

# Inverse or Back-Transform

Used to re-scale back to original time series

$$y_t = \begin{gather}\begin{cases}exp(w_t) & \text{if  }\lambda = 0\\(\lambda w_t+1)^{1/\lambda} & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{gather}$$

# Raw data

library(fpp)
```

Notice the increase in variation over time. This is not desirable so we
can use the log.

# Log of data

``` r
plot(log(elec),
     ylab = "Transformed electricity demand",
     xlab = "Year",
     main = "Transformed monthly electricity demand")
title(main = "Raw", line = -1)
```

This is better but towards the end of the series variability seems to
change

# Box-Cox

We need a lambda. We will let R provide one with `BoxCox.lambda`

``` r
lambda <- BoxCox.lambda(elec) # 0.265
plot(BoxCox(elec, lambda))
```

# Calendar Adjustments

Take into account eg. workdays, variability in days of the month.

``` r
monthdays <- rep(c(31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31),14) # 14 years of data
monthdays[26 + (4*12)*(0:2)] <- 29
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(milk,
     main = "Monthly milk production per cow",
     ylab = "Pounds",
     xlab = "Years")
plot(milk/monthdays,
     main = "Average milk production per cow per day",
     ylab = "Pounds",
     xlab = "Years")
```

This clearly gives a smoother time series

Other transformations should be used to take into account for example:

# Population Adjustments to account for variation in population size

# Inflation Adjustments
