**The Data**
```{r}
str(melsyd)
```

```{r}
plot(melsyd[,"Economy.Class"],
     main = "Economy class passengers: Melbourne-Sydney",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Thousands") 
```
Note the data gap in 1987 and the 0 values in 1989.

A trend is clear from 1990 to 1992.

No apparent seasonality.

```{r}
head(a10, n = -1L)
```
# Trend and Seasonality
```{r}
plot(a10,
     ylab = "$ million",
     xlab = "Year",
     main = "Antidiabetic drug sales")
```
This plot shows both a trend and seasonality
# `seasonplot()`
```{r}
seasonplot(a10,
     ylab = "$ million", xlab = "Year",
     main = "Antidiabetic drug sales",
     year.labels = TRUE, year.labels.left = TRUE,
     pch = 19,
     col = 1:20) 
```
This plot clearly shows the overall upward trend and the fact that each year
exhibits similar monthly patterns. It does show that 2008 was unusual because it decreased Feb-Mar.

# `monthplot()`

```{r}
monthplot(a10,
          ylab = "$ million",
          xlab = "Month",
          xaxt = "n",
          main = "Seasonal deviation plot: ADB Drug Sales")
axis(1, 
     at = 1:12, 
     labels = month.abb, 
     cex = 0.8) # cex here sets the magnification used for x axis
```
Here we see the mean for each month across the data set. (Not very interesting in this case.)

# Jitter plot
```{r}
plot(jitter(fuel[,5]),
            jitter(fuel[,8]),
            xlab = "city mpg",
            ylab = "Carbon Footprint")
```
Here the values are offset (jittered) to more easily see the relationship
Here we can see the time series relationship between two features

## Relationship between variables `pairs()`
```{r}
pairs(fuel[,-c(1:2, 4, 7)], pch = 19)
```
