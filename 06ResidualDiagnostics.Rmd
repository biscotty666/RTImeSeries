* Forecast Error (Residual): $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$

* Essential Forecasting Method: $e_i \sim i.i.d.(0,)$ (i.i.d.: independently identically distributed)
  * Residuals are uncorrelated
  * Residuals have zero mean

* Essential and Useful: $e_i \sim i.i.d. N(0,\sigma^2)$
  * Residuals have constant variance
  * Residuals are Normally distributed
  
* Random Walk, Naive Method: $e_t=y_t-\hat{y}_t=y_t-y_{t-1}$

```{r}
library(fpp)
dj2 <- window(dj, end=250)
plot(dj2,
     main = "Dow Jones Index (daily ending 15 Jul 94)",
     ylab = "",
     xlab = "Day")
```
```{r}
res <- residuals(naive(dj2))
plot(res,
     main = "Residuals from naive method",
     ylab = "",
     xlab = "Day")
```
This looks like noise. Let's check the ACF
```{r}
Acf(res, main = "ACF of residuals")
```
This confirms the randomness
```{r}
hist(res,
     nclass = "FD",
     main = "Histogram of residuals")
```
Not a normal distribution. 

**Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box Tests**

* `lag = 10` for non-seasonal
* `lab = 2m` for seasonal, `m` is period of seasonality
* `fitdf = k` where `k` is the lag
```{r}
Box.test(res,
         lag = 10,
         fitdf = 0)
```
```{r}
Box.test(res,
         lag = 10,
         fitdf = 0,
         type = "Lj")
```
This tests fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation in the data.
